#this program is for my git testing.
#print("This is a test for git. Thank you.")
#here we are learning about using double quotes in the same command. 
#we can use back slashes to avoid a bug ie.
print("Hello, \"friend\"")
name = input("What's your name? ")

#capitalizing the user's input
name = name.capitalize()

#using curly braces and the "f" notation to output a variable
print (f"Hello there, {name}")
response = input()

#removing white spaces from string
response = response.strip()
print("Thanks for your response")
